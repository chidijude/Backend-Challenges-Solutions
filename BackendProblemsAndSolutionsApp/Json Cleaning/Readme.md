# Remove all keys that have values of N/A, -, or empty strings. If one of these values appear in an array, remove that single item from the array. Then console log the modified object as a string.

# Sample case:
#     URL response -    {"name":{"first":"Daniel","middle":"N/A","last":"Smith"},"age":45}
#     Output solution - {"name":{"first":"Daniel","last":"Smith"},"age":45}
